# Maze Generator

Create maze using randomized depth-first search algorithm. preview can be seen [here](https://nandazman.github.io/maze-generator/)

## next algoritm:
- [ ] randomized Prim's algorithm
- [ ] Recursive division method

## maze display:
- [ ] hexagonal
- [ ] circle

## Maze solver
we use wall follwer method to solve the maze since the maze is guarantee connected. next algorithm:
- [ ] Pledge algorithm
- [ ] Tr√©maux's algorithm
